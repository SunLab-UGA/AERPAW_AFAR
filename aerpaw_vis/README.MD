These are external files for visualization of aspects of the rover search  
  
instructions:  
download the pickle file from the aerpaw container into a runXX folder with a number for XX  
>> pickels >> run27  
readme.txt within the run folder contains the rover actual location  
m_data.pickle is the measurment data (use plot_power.py)  
gp.pickle is the estimate progress (use plot_surf_animated.py)  

running the python file will automagically find the highest run folder (unless overridden)
